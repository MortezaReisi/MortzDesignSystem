Notes for myself: 
the Brand -1.json 
and 
Main Token.json 
is export from a .... plugin in figma. the problem is the color code export like this: 
```json
 "r": 0.843137264251709,
 "g": 0.843137264251709,
 "b": 0.843137264251709,
 "a": 1
```

and it's not helpful for me!
[  ] I must find a way for this!
